05/07/23, 8:52 pm - +91 98101 90241: Another IIT come up with Data science course....https://iitg.ac.in/acad/admission/online/
05/07/23, 10:59 pm - +91 90738 74106: Short summary: 

1. It's fully online through coursera, infact exams are also online at home.
 
2. Just 1 month campus immersion in entire 4 yrs. 

3. Unlike our DS degree, this degree can't be taken as sole graduation. It's just for skill development for job people/ people having offline college.

4. This degree students can't enter campus all time unlike us as they won't have id cards, no TA/ research intern at campus, no offline class in degree level, no offline fest. 

5. And most importantly it's through some mehta school of data science (not directly through iitg) so no placement will be given for this degree. Therefore this degree won't be as per other iitg degree as "online degree"  will be written in certificate.
05/07/23, 11:01 pm - +91 93450 90911: Isn't this course already out for months?
05/07/23, 11:43 pm - +91 93736 29345: What about iit patna bsc data analytics any idea https://admissions.iitp-cep.in/ug-course?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=PPC&utm_campaign=BZ_UG_Courses&gclid=CjwKCAjwqZSlBhBwEiwAfoZUIHukbkIc7uW0A_qwArpgdjwFUOqoru7ZSsdAJYavIDAYJUpflsS1qBoC054QAvD_BwE
05/07/23, 11:46 pm - +91 90738 74106: Yes it's good. At par our degree. But the difference is the seats are limited here (only 250).... So it will be very difficult to secure a seat there 😄. And it's a 3 yrs degree not 4 yrs. <This message was edited>
05/07/23, 11:57 pm - +91 93736 29345: Why do they have a seat limit so low doesn't it destroy the entire point of an online degree
05/07/23, 11:57 pm - +91 90738 74106: Doesn't it protects the point of being an IITIAN
05/07/23, 11:58 pm - +91 93736 29345: Yeah that's also correct

25/07/23, 11:31 am - +91 99320 29771: Yeah, you also get an MS in the process. But it's not called Integrated PhD or anything else, it's still just a PhD program. No separate admissions

25/07/23, 11:34 am - +91 99320 29771: It's been around for a while now, people just don't usually do it, and it's pretty hard to actually get an admission directly after Bachelors

```As mentioned in the grading document 5 marks will be provided for the Practice Assignments till Week 8. 

Based on practice assignments - 5 marks - applicable to only Foundation & Diploma courses (wherever practice assignments are provided)

If the average of the marks obtained in all the practice assignments (including programming) until week 8 AND mock tests conducted before Quiz 1 & Quiz 2 >= 40/100, students will get 5 marks.

We will take the final submission from the Week 1 to Week 8 assignments on August 7th, 2023. So we urge you to submit the assignments before the deadline. 

Note: If the course has no practice assignments before week 8 then no marks will be awarded as mentioned in the grading document & those who enrolled in the TDS course have no quizzes for them also they have to submit the assignments if any before the mentioned deadline.```

What if the exam timings overlap or if I get 2 different centers for 2 different courses at the same exam time? How does this work?  Any idea? <This message was edited>
02/08/23, 12:42 pm - +91 78792 30813: You can mail this issue to support team.
02/08/23, 12:43 pm - +91 93263 28554: Can I get the email ID?
02/08/23, 1:22 pm - +91 6351 525 764: Social networks exam is on Oct 28 check when is your other course exam
02/08/23, 1:23 pm - +91 93263 28554: Same day.
02/08/23, 1:25 pm - +91 6351 525 764: Idts centre will be different if you have exam on the same date, timings might vary
02/08/23, 1:25 pm - +91 6351 525 764: Then don't worry it won't overlap then
02/08/23, 1:25 pm - +91 6351 525 764: There would be people who would have taken these two courses together. If there was a clash a timings they would have given you the next day for exam
02/08/23, 1:25 pm - +91 6351 525 764: Nptel exams are on two days in the month of October
02/08/23, 1:30 pm - +91 93263 28554: The thing is, I've taken 2 courses with 2 different email IDs. There's no way they'll know it's the same person. That's the problem.

09/08/23, 6:14 pm - +91 6207 564 275: As of now there is no announcement for enrollment besides hostel won't be provided.very few students will get the chance to attend , so better not to count as offline classes
09/08/23, 6:15 pm - +91 6207 564 275: This could be done in other IITs if you have good connection with students and professors
09/08/23, 7:03 pm - +91 76775 46762: When have you joined this degree?
09/08/23, 7:47 pm - +91 94440 37774: Your perspective is paradoxical. My suggestion is if you keep on visiting IIT MADRAS atleast once in three months professors and technical team will recognise you. Library is accessible 24×7. Professors there are very friendly. Our Professor Andrew Thangaraj sir interacted with me for 10 minutes. He said students from Bihar coming to Chennai, staying in Mansions near IIT Madras, and keep on visiting the campus and clarifying doubts with course coordinators.
09/08/23, 7:49 pm - +91 94440 37774: One thing is if we want to clear doubts , a mail should be sent in advance to the iit degree support team.  After their reply mail , depending upon the availability of course instructors, we can visit the campus and clarify doubts.
09/08/23, 7:51 pm - +91 94440 37774: At the same time placement cell coordinators also we can  meet and get introduced. The placement cell and intern training are given in campus. It is also being notified in our mail. We should also check our mail regularly.
09/08/23, 7:53 pm - +91 94440 37774: A wide ocean of opportunities are there.
09/08/23, 7:56 pm - +91 94440 37774: I know this clearly, because I was there in the campus for 3 days. But stayed near IIT.
09/08/23, 9:03 pm - +91 82877 08928: That’s why I’ve written some
09/08/23, 9:17 pm - +91 6207 564 275: Is it so? When did it start
09/08/23, 9:28 pm - +91 89039 42489: Thanks for these informations
09/08/23, 9:43 pm - +91 94440 37774: Check your mail regularly

14/08/23, 4:41 pm - +91 81416 64088: Don't focus on the number of subjects, as they might present challenging questions on topics such as probability and more. We have limited resources for data science preparation for the GATE exam, and we also don't have previous year's questions and various other materials. To clarify, I am not a GATE aspirant; I simply wanted to share my viewpoint.

The Details of the first Movie Night of Dunkirk are - 
Date - 20 August 2023

07/09/23, 3:35 pm - +91 99113 48266: its dumb and too much pressure

07/09/23, 4:58 pm - +91 79782 53449: 🥲
07/09/23, 5:00 pm - +91 820 910 0349: I think it's a great idea
07/09/23, 5:04 pm - +91 78761 52525: i agree with Tushar
07/09/23, 5:05 pm - +91 78761 52525: it something based on regular feedback from industry as students tends to only focus on theoretical concepts and run behind the quiz preps and not focussing on extra skill that are required in industry .
07/09/23, 5:06 pm - +91 78761 52525: these points are to help student to brush up the concepts during palcements
07/09/23, 5:06 pm - +91 79782 53449: True it's a great idea by IIC
07/09/23, 5:07 pm - +91 820 910 0349: also we should not think everything IIT does is for a bad reason right? they're eventually trying to make the course better

Also no body is asking student to take 4 subs , one can do 1 sub and work on portfolio building side by side <This message was edited>

11/09/23, 12:04 am - +91 88600 72542: I will confirm the support team and others. And then if this is the case I Will create a post when other problems on Discourse die down. There's only so much Discourse can take.
11/09/23, 12:19 am - +91 82877 08928: Why nothing 
Complete bs and you will get alumnus status
11/09/23, 12:21 am - +91 99942 55842: But most of the people started this with just finishing BSc only. bS was only introduced later.
11/09/23, 12:21 am - +91 94295 63006: Suicide cases are increasing in iits this is the reason

11/09/23, 12:26 am - +91 99942 55842: Pretty sure the reason and the intent with which this programme was started is no more the same. And where in the world a diploma and graduation degree (including bsc) doesn't entitle a alumni status. Strange.
11/09/23, 7:51 am - +91 78784 29486: Yes please do that
11/09/23, 7:51 am - +91 78784 29486: What document is this btw ?

11/09/23, 8:16 am - +91 78784 29486: We should raise this issue
11/09/23, 8:16 am - +91 78784 29486: They lured us in by this marketing gimmick that we'll get alumni status
11/09/23, 8:16 am - +91 78784 29486: And now they have changed it all together
11/09/23, 8:17 am - +91 88600 72542: Yeah, in some days.
11/09/23, 8:17 am - +91 88600 72542: Are you planning to leave the program after completing BSc <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 8:18 am - +91 78784 29486: I was yes
11/09/23, 8:19 am - +91 78784 29486: We have to get a clear answer over another thing that whether the BSc be considered as a proper "UG degree" or not
11/09/23, 8:19 am - +91 88600 72542: Yeah that's what
11/09/23, 8:19 am - +91 88600 72542: Are you gonna be called a graduate or not

20/09/23, 5:59 pm - +91 90821 17282: Actly, was searching for something which help me in our Data science
20/09/23, 6:00 pm - +91 93736 29345: Programming nptel courses aren't compulsory and don't count in cgpa you have to give up a easy elective which could have improved your cgpa hsmg nptel are compulsory so do those instead
20/09/23, 6:00 pm - +91 820 910 0349: it also depends on what knowledge you have right now
20/09/23, 6:00 pm - +91 820 910 0349: which level are you in
20/09/23, 6:01 pm - +91 90821 17282: Foundation 😅

20/09/23, 6:02 pm - +91 90821 17282: C++ and Html  ( 11th , 12th)
20/09/23, 6:02 pm - +91 820 910 0349: school knowledge doesn't count
20/09/23, 6:02 pm - +91 93736 29345: Just practice dsa oops etc these nptel arent worth it and are not even compulsory
20/09/23, 6:03 pm - +91 820 910 0349: focus on your basics like mathematics and programming
20/09/23, 6:03 pm - +91 93736 29345: Plus you have to sacrifice an easy elective in degree level which could have improved your cgpa
20/09/23, 6:04 pm - +91 820 910 0349: there are ample amounts of free courses offered by good Institutions for linear algebra, why don't you take up those and practice more? don't focus on nptel courses rn
20/09/23, 6:04 pm - +91 82877 08928: Degree has easy electives too?
20/09/23, 6:04 pm - +91 90821 17282: Oh 😯
20/09/23, 6:04 pm - +91 82877 08928: I thought all are tough🥲
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +91 93736 29345: The complusory programming ones are really hard but the optional hsmg ones are easy
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +91 820 910 0349: if you don't study everything is tough
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +91 82877 08928: But hsmg to only 1 we can take
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +91 90821 17282: Oh yep ,
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +91 90821 17282: For e.g

20/09/23, 6:06 pm - +91 93736 29345: at least 1 is compulsory but you can take more
20/09/23, 6:06 pm - +91 820 910 0349: itni research toh khud karlo, sab spoon feed thodi hoga bacha
20/09/23, 6:06 pm - +91 820 910 0349: ye attitude rakhoge toh diploma bhi nhi nikal paoge

20/09/23, 6:08 pm - +91 820 910 0349: there would be little to no spoon feeding in courses like MAD2 or MLT, uske liye research based mindset pahale hi banalo
20/09/23, 6:08 pm - +91 820 910 0349: research Karo aur pichlo
20/09/23, 6:08 pm - +91 820 910 0349: puchlo*

20/09/23, 6:11 pm - +91 820 910 0349: I believe merko mad2 aur system commands thoda ajeeb laga
20/09/23, 6:11 pm - +91 82877 08928: Yahi 2 bache hai

20/09/23, 6:41 pm - +91 98366 91577: knowledge koi nai leta nptel se utna, and not even half of these in house courses
20/09/23, 6:41 pm - +91 98366 91577: wo khudse hi parna hota hai
20/09/23, 6:41 pm - +91 89550 22422: What do you mean by in house courses
20/09/23, 6:42 pm - +91 98366 91577: courses offered by iitm as elective are called inhouse courses
20/09/23, 6:42 pm - +91 93736 29345: Lekin agar hsmg electives karte ho nptel ki jagah to cgpa improve ho ta hai
20/09/23, 6:42 pm - +91 98366 91577: yes correct, nptel doesnt count in cgpa
20/09/23, 6:43 pm - +91 98366 91577: toh agar gira hua hai cgpa aur increase karna hai then do hsmg inhouse instead of from nptel
20/09/23, 6:43 pm - +91 90821 17282: So it's a kinda loss
20/09/23, 6:43 pm - +91 79032 81977: 🥹 kabhi kabhi kharaab bhi ho jataa h
20/09/23, 6:43 pm - +91 82877 08928: Is this true ? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 6:43 pm - +91 98366 91577: depends, if you score very badly but pass and still your cgpa doesnt drop, i wont count that as a 'loss'
20/09/23, 6:44 pm - +91 79032 81977: Sudarshan sir told this ........ turu to hona chaahiye
20/09/23, 6:44 pm - +91 93736 29345: Degree mai saare compulsory courses tough hai cgpa improve ke liye hsmg mai thoda chance hai improve ke liye.
20/09/23, 6:44 pm - +91 82877 08928: Like suppose you score very very high in a course 
So u can do research under the IIT faculty offering it?
20/09/23, 6:45 pm - +91 93736 29345: Programming degree level courses se improve karna bohot hard hai toh yeh optional hsmg mai hi chance hai
20/09/23, 6:45 pm - +91 79032 81977: only in NPTEL course
20/09/23, 6:45 pm - +91 89550 22422: What is a good cgpa according to you
20/09/23, 6:45 pm - +91 79032 81977: 10 :)

22/09/23, 11:40 pm - +91 98366 91577: We are planning to enable personalised tutoring/mentoring sessions for all the courses of the Foundation and Diploma levels (except English 1 & 2) for the Sept 2023 term

Students who are interested in this personalised tutoring session will be allocated a Senior Student Tutor who will 
Interact with you for about 5 hours every week - discussing the content of the week for that course
Clearing your doubts in content of that week
Assisting with understanding the assignment questions and helping you solve it if you are stuck

The Tutor will be allotted 10 students and as a group - you can fix a mutually convenient time and learn with each other.

Duration: 5 hours/week for 12 weeks of course duration
Live session and support Time: <<Need to update>>
Mode of tutoring: Online
Tutor Allocation: 10 students with 1 tutor

We have seen that this is a very effective way for those students who are unable to study from the program on their own and are unable to clarify their doubts from just the generic live sessions but require more support to go through the course.

What you have to do:

There is payment of Rs. 2000/course for this session which is enabled under the pending payment section. Students who are registered for more than one course have to pay Rs. 2000 for each course before the deadline. Deadline for the payment 25th September 2023. Students who are attending all sessions will get the refund of Rs. 1000 to their student wallet for the respective course.

23/09/23, 8:03 pm - +91 81307 12622: Buddy see, in an orientation of foundation which was made for students like about 2 years back or maybe 1.... so in that orientation Sir mentioned that this degree is not BTech bcz, in BTech degrees there has to be a lot of courses of maths physics & chemistry, but in this degree we do not need that stuff... so that is why this is a BS degree not a BTech degree... i think this was  one of the points he mentioned when a question was asked by a student about this... that's all I know..... <This message was edited>
23/09/23, 8:07 pm - +91 90821 17282: Btech is more technology based ( technical stuffs ) while a BSc is more sort of theoretical based
23/09/23, 8:10 pm - +91 99538 06838: Math 2 week 1 feels like toofan ke pehle ki shanti
23/09/23, 8:13 pm - +91 93699 94943: Good analysis 🙃
23/09/23, 8:14 pm - +91 6370 520 829: I have done a BS program (offline university) and it taught everything including Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and even Humanities in the first three semesters.
23/09/23, 8:15 pm - +91 81307 12622: You are a LEGEND.... _*I don't what to say now*_
23/09/23, 8:16 pm - +91 6370 520 829: Don't misunderstand, I didn't like it and dropped out to pursue this IITM degree fulltime.
23/09/23, 8:17 pm - +91 98366 91577: Btech cannot be delivered online in india, simple.
23/09/23, 8:17 pm - +91 82877 08928: True 
The tornado starts in week 2
23/09/23, 8:17 pm - +91 6370 520 829: I believe that's the real reason

23/09/23, 8:26 pm - +91 93347 27093: And this  bs is a focused degree on specific domain
23/09/23, 8:30 pm - +91 89027 64439: Anyone taken mathematical thinking?
23/09/23, 8:31 pm - +91 93347 27093: Ye kha padhate hai 🤔

23/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 89550 22422: For data science
23/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 89550 22422: I don’t think there is btech
23/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 89550 22422: For now atleast
23/09/23, 8:34 pm - +91 93347 27093: There is

23/09/23, 8:47 pm - +91 6370 520 829: Very good CGPA from very reputable university don't matter. Just having a minimum CGPA will be enough.
23/09/23, 8:48 pm - +91 6370 520 829: Something like good performance on Kaggle (for machine learning job) will also be good
23/09/23, 8:50 pm - +91 87542 51749: I mean in abroad*
23/09/23, 9:07 pm - +91 89550 22422: Bhai ye tatti se jwaab mt do

23/09/23, 9:19 pm - +91 90792 41015: wait this also matter??
23/09/23, 9:20 pm - +91 87542 51749: Ya some master courses require certain credits.
23/09/23, 9:20 pm - +91 90792 41015: and what about work experience? that is also required?
23/09/23, 9:22 pm - +91 87542 51749: Aah, idk abt that ..
23/09/23, 9:22 pm - +91 90792 41015: ohh ok no problem
23/09/23, 9:24 pm - +91 6302 888 846: Can we do mastes with this iitmbs in other countries.
23/09/23, 9:26 pm - +91 87542 51749: Same doubt here
23/09/23, 9:26 pm - +91 6302 888 846: Sir said some limited universities. But if iitmbs gets only worst university then it's not worth it.
23/09/23, 9:27 pm - +91 87542 51749: 🥲
23/09/23, 9:27 pm - +91 90792 41015: but y they wouldn't allow us?
23/09/23, 9:27 pm - +91 87542 51749: So i shouldn''t be doing this full time🫤
23/09/23, 9:27 pm - +91 6302 888 846: Btech > BS
23/09/23, 9:28 pm - +91 81004 30768: We won't be doing masters anytime before 2027/2028. By then, things ought to be better.
23/09/23, 9:28 pm - +91 6302 888 846: That's all I also hoping for.
23/09/23, 9:29 pm - +91 90792 41015: how can u be so sure like if they want to change that they would have already done that
23/09/23, 9:31 pm - +91 81004 30768: Not sure. We'd get a better idea of the circumstances once people complete 4 years.
23/09/23, 9:32 pm - +91 6201 437 863: Bhai kr skte masters india ya kisi country me
23/09/23, 9:33 pm - +91 6201 437 863: Bhai to 4 saal lgega hi na bachelor me
23/09/23, 9:33 pm - +91 81004 30768: Wohi toh
23/09/23, 9:34 pm - +91 90792 41015: and about that most of the european countries just has BS then they must allow us.
23/09/23, 9:35 pm - +91 6302 888 846: We are in experimental stage right now
23/09/23, 9:37 pm - +91 6302 888 846: It will take few years. Definitely first 3 to 4 batches sucks
23/09/23, 9:39 pm - +91 82877 08928: This is absolutely fake
23/09/23, 9:39 pm - +91 82877 08928: No one ever said this
23/09/23, 9:39 pm - +91 82877 08928: Don’t spread such information if you don’t know about it
23/09/23, 9:41 pm - +91 82877 08928: Nothing experimental 
Bs has been going on for years 
And all universities accept it
23/09/23, 9:42 pm - +91 6302 888 846: True bro even gate iit mtech also not all colleges. Andrew sir said in apprenticeship session.
23/09/23, 9:42 pm - +91 82877 08928: Sir said if any college allows a 4 year degree for MTech 
Bs is completely eligible
23/09/23, 9:43 pm - +91 82877 08928: Obviously if someone asks for a btech CSE then it won’t 
But if it just asks a 4 year degree it’s full aceeptable
23/09/23, 9:43 pm - +91 82877 08928: Same for abroad
23/09/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82877 08928: Bs is a very common degree abroad
23/09/23, 9:44 pm - +91 91610 49419: ya this is now correct 👍
23/09/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82877 08928: Accepted everywhere
23/09/23, 9:45 pm - +91 6302 888 846: We have some online tag that's why I am asking.
23/09/23, 9:45 pm - +91 90821 17282: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 9:46 pm - +91 82877 08928: Can you see online anywhere in the degree certificate?
23/09/23, 9:46 pm - +91 95212 73301: No online tags in any degree certificate
23/09/23, 9:46 pm - +91 82877 08928: Exactly
23/09/23, 9:47 pm - +91 81004 30768: The degree isn't online, the program is. The word 'online' won't be mentioned in your degree.

23/09/23, 9:49 pm - +91 6302 888 846: They should make offline for BS level.

23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 89550 22422: No work experience required
23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 82877 08928: In bs
23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 89550 22422: It is country based
23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 89550 22422: Like usa adds some extra points for work experience
23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 89550 22422: That is all
23/09/23, 9:50 pm - +91 89550 22422: It is not a require

23/09/23, 9:51 pm - +91 89550 22422: Recently a student from this very program got into university of minnesota
23/09/23, 9:51 pm - +91 89550 22422: Ms in data science
23/09/23, 9:52 pm - +91 87542 51749: Ya, i was not so sure that's why I wanted to clarify.
23/09/23, 9:52 pm - +91 89550 22422: Are yaar data science ka koi mtech ni hota bahar
23/09/23, 9:52 pm - +91 89550 22422: Khi bhi dekh lo
23/09/23, 9:52 pm - +91 89550 22422: Ms hota hai

23/09/23, 9:53 pm - +91 89550 22422: But was in a completely different field that computers
23/09/23, 9:53 pm - +91 91610 49419: Outside there is no b tech is BS
23/09/23, 9:53 pm - +91 89550 22422: So it is only possible she got in because of this degree
23/09/23, 9:53 pm - +91 91610 49419: its*

23/09/23, 9:56 pm - +91 89550 22422: Bhai ivy league ek minority hai
